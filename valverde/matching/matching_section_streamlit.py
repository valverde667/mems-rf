"""Script to investigate matching section before accelerating lattice. The
2018 paper found suitable solutions from six voltage settings and a FDDFFD
setup. The six voltages were in Volts: 551, -510, -512, 359, 352, -136.
Executing <streamlit run match_section_streamlit.py> in the terminal will open
a browser window where the voltages can be set and the solution to the KV
envelope equation will be plotted in this matching region."""
