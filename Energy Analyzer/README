multirun_calibration.py:
Script to batch run spectrometer_sim_calibration

spectrometer_sim_calibration.py
spawns single particle in spectrometer, written to be run in batch

spectrometer_sim.py
specrometer simulation, that uses the particle files given by the single-species-simulations

multirunner_spec.py
multiruns the spectrometer_sim.py

calibration_evaluation.py

spectrometer_eval.py
plots a histogram/plot of the particle distribution on a screen behind the deflectors

calibration_evaluation.py
plots the screen location vs particle speed vs deflector voltage

Regarding Step 1, 2, 3 
I have to write down more how to use the simulations
Step1:
for the particle postions stored from the single-species-simulation
step2: 
stores the particle after the travel through the analyzer
step3:
stores the final evaluation and plots

Interpolation.p & deflector_scope_data_eval.py:
this is a tricky one as thy does not belong in this folder. Instead I copy the files into the data directory of a deflector scan and adapt it to the needs there. Interpolation.py is used to be able to return the particle energy for a specific deflection voltage and screen psotiton.
The simulation gives f(x,y) = z, this allows for g(z,y) = x basically.
