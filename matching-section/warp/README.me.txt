The folders Newer and Older Warp contain the .py files used to execute the warp simulations. 
	Many of the Newer warp runs use the geometry and geometry_test7 files which are 
	included in the folder.
The pdf for both Newer and Older contains a log with info on each run. 
The geometry file is from the sssft simulations. 
The geometry_singlet is from the sssft file, but with adjustments to the wafers, and with 
	the ESQ_singlet() function.
The warp_matching_section is the main file from the most updated warp runs, it uses both 
	the geometry and geometry_singlet files. This file came from run35.0.py as that 
	was a representative file for the matching section solution. It uses ESQ singlets, 
	and no RF acceleration. 
Also the CGM files from these simulations are in zip folders in google drive
