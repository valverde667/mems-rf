The original KV Equation Envelope file simply calculates and plots the output. 
The updated KV Equation Envelope (.py and jupyter notebook) includes updated plotting, 
	added ESQ wafer positions on graph, and the option to import data from java or 
	warp for comparison. 
The Stability Analysis (.py and jupyter notebook) includes the plotting of warp results 
	for varying voltages, beam angle, beam radius, current, and emittance. 
The Warp_CSV folder includes the CSV files exported by warp from run34.0-40.6
PNGs of examples from the updated KV Equation file show the results for a matched solution.
