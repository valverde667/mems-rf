single-species-simulation.py:
    Original file by maddy with some editing by me, mainly some cleanup and changes with the file output as well as saving particles crossing specific z-locations after the final RF-unit. For use of inserting those particles into my Energy analyzer simulation.
    
geometry.py: 
re-written RF-stack etc
geometry can now be set manually to mimik the actual setup of the wafers, which are not set perfectly

single_species_simulation_for_thread.py:
I removed a lot of unnececarry stuff and added some cofig options from the command line. It can be used with the multirunner skript.
Makes use of ne RF stack design, which allows for manual arrangement of RF wafers to be able to simulate actual setup

multirunner.py:
small script which calls list of single_species_simulation_for_thread simulations in new threads.
