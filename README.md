README
======

Collect all the simulations files for the Arpa-E project.

In general, feel free to add files, branches, etc.

Before you add a new pdf with results in the results folder, please
make sure that you commited all your changes to git. This way the pdf
will contain the correct git hash and it will be easy to later
reproduce the results if needed.

Files:
=====

helper.py    -- some general python routines
geometry.py  -- definitions of different wafer configurations
esq.py       -- simulations of an array of esq wafers
