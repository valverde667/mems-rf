This directory acts as a separate testing bed for parts of the meqalac simulation
code.

Files

-workingnotes.docx: A set of notes I keep to document useful code snippets,
questions, future improvements, etc.

Directories

-Geometry: This directory is where I test code for creating the meqalac geometry.
These test include directly testing conductors loaded onto the mesh as well as
program structure and algorithms for better coding.
